/// - `state`: [`CompressState`] so the compressor can refer to data prior to

/// - `last_block`: Whether or not this block is going to be the last block in the frame
///   (needed because this info is written into the block header)
/// - `uncompressed_data`: A block's worth of uncompressed data, taken from the
///   larger input
/// - `output`: As `uncompressed_data` is compressed, it's appended to `output`.
